# Univariate Kernel Density Estimation Despiking

This repository contains code with an implementation of the univariate kernel density despising algorithm of Kraus, S., and Strom, K. (2024). Simplified Kernel Density-Based Algorithm for Despiking ADV Data. Submitted for review to the *Journal of Hydraulic Engineering*.

The repository contains,

1. Sample ADV data collected with a side-looking Nortek Vectrino (in the `Data` folder)
2. An implementation of the despiking method in `UKDE_despike_v02.py`
3. And a Jupyter notebook (`ADV_data_exploretimeseries.ipynb`) with an example of how to use the despiking functions.

Please contact Sam Kraus samakraus@vt.edu or Kyle Strom strom@vt.edu with questions.
