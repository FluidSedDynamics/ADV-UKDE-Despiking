# Univariate Kernel Density Estimation Despiking

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/811988881.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14614090)

This repository contains code implementing the univariate kernel density despising algorithm of Kraus, S., and Strom, K. (2024). Simplified Kernel Density-Based Algorithm for Despiking ADV Data, accepted for publication in the *Journal of Hydraulic Engineering*.

The repository contains,

1. Sample ADV data collected with a side-looking Nortek Vectrino (in the `Data` folder)
2. An implementation of the despiking method in `UKDE_despike_v02.py`
3. And a Jupyter notebook (`ADV_data_exploretimeseries.ipynb`) with an example of how to use the despiking functions.

Here is a [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/jr2axsy0qLs) explaining the files in this repository and walking through a simple use case.
